PROBLEM STATEMENTS:

1. Consider a sinusoidal message signal of 1000Hz. For this signal design, a sampling &
reconstruction scheme (for simplicity, consider impulse train for sampling) using MATLAB.
Particularly, you need to display the following:
(a) Sampled signal & reconstructed signal in the time domain under the scenario of
oversampling.
(b) Sampled signal & reconstructed signal in the time domain at Nyquist sampling rate
(c) Sampled signal & reconstructed signal in the time domain under the scenario of
undersampling.
(d) Frequency domain representation of the oversampled signal, and on the basis of it, you
should be able to explain the importance of Nyquist criterion.
(e) Frequency domain representation of the undersampled signal and based on it you should
be able to explain aliasing.

2. Design a BPSK Bandpass modulation and demodulation scheme in MATLAB Simulink using
a sinusoidal carrier of 100kHz. Particularly, you need to display:
(a) A 16-bit random binary sequence the corresponding BPSK modulated waveform.
(b) Demodulation of the BPSK signal and extracted the binary sequence.
(c) Include white Gaussian noise in the generated BPSK signal and demonstrate that as you
increase the noise strength the extraction becomes prone to errors.
(d) Consider two suitable cases of high and low noise strength and calculate the bit error rate
(BER) using your script/model.
